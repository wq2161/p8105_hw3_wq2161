## Problem 1

Load the *instacart* data from the *p8105.datasets*.

``` r
data("instacart")
instacart = instacart %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

-   Description of the *instacart* dataset

The instacart dataset includes information on some of the items ordered
from instacart online grocery website. It contains 15 variables which
are order\_id, product\_id, add\_to\_cart\_order, reordered, user\_id,
eval\_set, order\_number, order\_dow, order\_hour\_of\_day,
days\_since\_prior\_order, product\_name, aisle\_id, department\_id,
aisle, department. Specifically, **order\_dow** is the day of the week
on which the order was placed, and **order\_hour\_of\_day** is the hour
of the day on which the order was placed. There are 1384617 items where
each row of the dataset is an ordered item.

For example, the first item was ordered by the user with user id 112108,
and the order id is 1. It is a Bulgarian Yogurt with product id 49302,
which belongs to yogurt aisle with aisle id 120 and the department of
dairy eggs with department id 16. The order in which this item was added
to cart was 1, and this product has been ordered by this user in the
past since reorder has value of 1. This order is the 4 order for this
user. It was placed on the 10 hour of the day and the 4 day of the week.
The days since the last order for the user is 9. It belongs to the
“train” evaluation set.

-   How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?

``` r
aisle_num = instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarize(n_aisle = n())
aisle_num
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                  n_aisle
    ##    <chr>                    <int>
    ##  1 air fresheners candles    1067
    ##  2 asian foods               7007
    ##  3 baby accessories           306
    ##  4 baby bath body care        328
    ##  5 baby food formula        13198
    ##  6 bakery desserts           1501
    ##  7 baking ingredients       13088
    ##  8 baking supplies decor     1094
    ##  9 beauty                     287
    ## 10 beers coolers             1839
    ## # … with 124 more rows

``` r
most_items = aisle_num %>%
  mutate(aisle_rank = min_rank(desc(n_aisle))) %>%
  filter(aisle_rank == 1)
most_items
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   aisle            n_aisle aisle_rank
    ##   <chr>              <int>      <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables  150609          1

There are 134 aisles. The aisle that the most items ordered from is
fresh vegetables.

-   Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
    limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
    aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
aisle_num %>%
  filter(n_aisle > 10000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n_aisle, color = aisle)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "The Number of Items Ordered in Each Aisle",
    subtitle = "Aisles with more than 10,000 items ordered",
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "Number of Items Ordered",
    caption = "Data from instacart"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = NULL)
```

-   Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
    aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
    vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered
    in your table.

``` r
product_num = instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>%
  summarize(n_product = n()) %>%
  mutate(product_rank = min_rank(desc(n_product))) %>%
  filter(product_rank <= 3) %>%
  arrange(aisle, product_rank)

product_num
```

    ## # A tibble: 9 × 4
    ## # Groups:   aisle [3]
    ##   aisle                      product_name                 n_product product_rank
    ##   <chr>                      <chr>                            <int>        <int>
    ## 1 baking ingredients         Light Brown Sugar                  499            1
    ## 2 baking ingredients         Pure Baking Soda                   387            2

    ## 4 dog food care              Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice…        30            1
    ## 5 dog food care              Organix Chicken & Brown Ric…        28            2
    ## 6 dog food care              Small Dog Biscuits                  26            3
    ## 7 packaged vegetables fruits Organic Baby Spinach              9784            1
    ## 8 packaged vegetables fruits Organic Raspberries               5546            2
    ## 9 packaged vegetables fruits Organic Blueberries               4966            3

The three most popular items in “baking ingredients” aisle are Light

in “dog food care” aisle are Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog
Treats, Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe, Small Dog Biscuits. The

-   Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
    format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
mean_hour = instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(
    mean = mean(order_hour_of_day)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    order_dow = recode(order_dow,
                       `0` = "Sun",
                       `1` = "Mon",
                       `2` = "Tue",
                       `3` = "Wed",
                       `4` = "Thu",
                       `5` = "Fri",
                       `6` = "Sat"
    )
  ) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean,
  )

mean_hour %>% knitr::kable(digit = 2)
```

| product\_name    |   Sun |   Mon |   Tue |   Wed |   Thu |   Fri |   Sat |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

The table shows the mean hour of the day at which Coffee Ice Cream, Pink
Lady Apples are ordered on each day of the week. There are 7 days in a
week range from 0 to 6, and the mean hour of the day are all above 10
hours.

## Problem 2
